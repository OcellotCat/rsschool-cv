3. I want to become a Front-End developer. The most important thing for me is the opportunity to develop to reach a new level. I would like to interact
with a large team but not depend on it 100%. I am a person who needs to research certain aspects of the specialty for a very long time, otherwise I will not
have confidence in what I am doing. I need comprehensive knowledge to start acting, but when I get it, it's impossible to stop me.
I study slower than others, but I work efficiently.Also, when working in a team, I feel people well and see their strengths.
At this stage, I work for a company that deals with organizational measures to ensure information security, I do not see
any serious prospects for myself in this. I think that the work of a developer is much more interesting and I could do it for many years. 
4. At this stage, this is my first course in development, these are my first skills. But I intend to advance in this with the help of this course and subsequent steps.
