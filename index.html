                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>I want to become a Front-End developer.
                    The most important thing for me is the opportunity to develop to reach a new level.
                    I would like to interact with a large team but not depend on it 100%. 
                    I am a person who needs to research certain aspects of the specialty for a very long time,
                    otherwise I will not have confidence in what I am doing.
                    I need comprehensive knowledge to start acting, but when I get it,
                    it's impossible to stop me.I study slower than others, but I work efficiently.Also,
                    when working in a team, I feel people well and see their strengths.
                    At this stage, I work for a company that deals with organizational measures to ensure
                    information security, I do not see any serious prospects for myself in this.
                    I think that the work of a developer is much more interesting and I could do it for many years.</p>
